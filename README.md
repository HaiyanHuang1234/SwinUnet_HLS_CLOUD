# SwinUnet_hls_Cloud

The code is for the work titled 'A global Swin-Unet Sentinel-2 surface reflectance-based cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm for the NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset' It is an application of Swin-Unet for cloud and cloud shadow detection. Our paper has been submitted to the journal Science of Remote Sensing.


# Environment

Please prepare an environment with TensorFlow 2.7 and Python 3.7.16. 

# steps

1. Download the pre-trained model and test examples.
   as the pre-trained model is >100MB, git-lfs is needed: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Access-Planet-DL/SwinUnet_HLS_CLOUD.git
   ```
  
3. Unzip the pretrained model
   ```bash
   unzip trained_model.zip
   ```
4. Run classification on the test data, modify the "inputdir" and "model_path" to the folders where the test data and the unzipped trained model are saved.
   ```bash
   python hls_swin_cloud_shadow.py
   ```

It will replicate the examples shown in Figure 8 of the paper.
